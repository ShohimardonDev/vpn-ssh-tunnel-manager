# Server VPN SSH Manager

This repository contains a script that manages SSH and VPN tunnels for connecting to remote servers securely. The script allows you to easily configure multiple server connections, establish SSH sessions, and optionally create VPN tunnels. It provides a flexible mechanism for managing server connections through SSH port forwarding, including the ability to handle existing processes using specific ports.

## Features

- **Multiple Server Configurations**: Easily define multiple server connections with individual configurations.
- **SSH Key Authentication**: Supports SSH key-based authentication for secure and automated logins.
- **Port Forwarding**: Configure local and remote ports for seamless communication between your local machine and remote services.
- **VPN Tunnel Support**: Automatically establishes a VPN tunnel to securely route traffic for specific services.
- **Process Management**: Automatically detects and kills processes using specified ports to avoid conflicts before establishing connections.
- **Dynamic Server Selection**: Choose from a list of predefined servers and configurations dynamically during runtime.

## Requirements

- **Expect**: This script is written in Expect, which automates interactions with command-line tools like SSH.
- **Unix-based System**: This script is intended to run on Unix-like systems (macOS, Linux). The use of `lsof` and other Unix utilities are required.
- **SSH**: Ensure SSH is set up on the system, and keys are properly configured for authentication.
- **VPN Configuration**: Optionally, a VPN server and related configuration can be provided to securely route traffic.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Configure Servers
The script uses an array to store the configuration details for multiple servers, including:
- **`host`**: The server's IP address.
- **`user`**: The SSH user.
- **`ssh_port`**: The SSH port (default `22`, customizable).
- **`remote_ip`** and **`remote_port`**: Internal services to be accessed.
- **`local_port`**: Local port for communication.
- **`ssh_key`**: Path to the private SSH key for authentication.
- **`vpn_tunnel`** (optional): Configuration to establish a VPN tunnel.

Example of server configuration:

```tcl
array set servers {
    1 {
        name "Server 1"
        host "2.3.1.2"
        user "username"
        ssh_port "22"
        remote_ip "10.10.0.1"
        remote_port "3306"
        local_port "8888"
        password "password_here"
        ssh_key "~/.ssh/key_path"
        vpn_tunnel {
            password "vpn_server_password"
            ssh_key "~/.ssh/vpn_key.key"
            local_port "1235"
            remote_ip "2.2.4.6"
            remote_port "3422"
            user "vpn_user"
            host "2.2.5.9"
            ssh_port "22"
        }
    }
}
```

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Define Servers and Configuration
You can configure the servers and their connection details in the script, specifying the serverâ€™s name, host, SSH credentials, VPN tunnel configurations, and other required parameters.

### Step 2: Establish VPN Tunnel (Optional)
If a VPN tunnel is configured for the server, the script will attempt to establish it before connecting to the server. This is particularly useful for securing communication when accessing internal services behind a VPN.

### Step 3: Kill Processes Using a Specific Port
The script will automatically check for any processes that are using the specified local port and kill them if necessary. This ensures that the port is available for the new connection.

### Step 4: SSH Connection
Once the VPN tunnel is established (if configured), the script uses SSH to connect to the specified server, applying port forwarding to access remote services. If any authentication prompts occur, the script will handle them automatically, sending passwords or passphrases as needed.

### Step 5: Interactive SSH Session
After the SSH connection is established, the script optionally interacts with the server session, allowing you to run commands as needed.

## Installation

### For macOS

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ShohimardonDev/vpn-ssh-tunnel-manager.git
    cd repo-name
    ```

2. Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x connect_server.sh
    ```

3. Move the script to `/usr/local/bin` for global access:

    ```bash
    sudo mv connect_server.sh /usr/local/bin/tunnel
    ```

4. Ensure the script is executable from anywhere:

    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/tunnel
    ```

5. Now you can run the script from anywhere:

    ```bash
    tunnel
    ```

### For Linux

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ShohimardonDev/vpn-ssh-tunnel-manager.git
    cd repo-name
    ```

2. Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x connect_server.sh
    ```

3. Move the script to `/usr/local/bin` for global access:

    ```bash
    sudo mv connect_server.sh /usr/local/bin/tunnel
    ```

4. Ensure the script is executable from anywhere:

    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/tunnel
    ```

5. Now you can run the script from anywhere:

    ```bash
    tunnel
    ```

## Security Considerations

- **Passwords:** It's not recommended to store passwords in plaintext for production use. Consider using environment variables or secrets management tools for storing sensitive information.
  
- **SSH Keys:** It's recommended to use SSH keys for authentication instead of passwords for added security.

- **VPN Configurations:** When using VPNs, ensure that your VPN credentials are kept secure and never pushed to a public repository.
